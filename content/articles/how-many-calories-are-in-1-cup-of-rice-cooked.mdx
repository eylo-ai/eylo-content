**1 cup of cooked rice typically has about 200 calories**—most often **~205 calories for cooked white rice** and **~215–220 calories for cooked brown rice**, assuming it’s plain rice cooked in water with no added fat. The exact number can shift based on the type of rice and how “packed” the cup is.

## The calorie count for 1 cup cooked rice (by type)

A “cup” sounds precise, but rice varies a lot by variety and how it’s cooked. Here are reliable ballpark numbers for **1 cup cooked (about 150–160 g)**:

- **White rice (long-grain, cooked): ~200–210 calories**  
  Common estimate: **~205 calories**
- **Brown rice (cooked): ~215–220 calories**  
  Slightly higher due to a bit more fat and fiber
- **Jasmine or basmati (cooked): ~200–210 calories**  
  Similar to other white rices when cooked plain
- **Short-grain/“sticky” rice (cooked): often ~210–240 calories**  
  Can run higher because it’s denser and packs into a cup more tightly

### Macros you can expect (plain cooked rice)
For **1 cup cooked white rice**, a typical macro profile is roughly:
- **Carbs:** ~45 g  
- **Protein:** ~4 g  
- **Fat:** ~0–1 g  
- **Fiber:** ~0–1 g  

For **1 cup cooked brown rice**, roughly:
- **Carbs:** ~45 g  
- **Protein:** ~5 g  
- **Fat:** ~2 g  
- **Fiber:** ~3–4 g  

Rice is mostly carbohydrate, with small amounts of protein and minimal fat unless you cook it with oil/butter or mix in higher-calorie add-ons.

## Why the number changes: cup size, packing, and cooking method

Even if you always use “1 cup,” the calories can swing more than people expect. The biggest reasons:

### 1) A cup is volume, not weight
Rice can be fluffy and airy or dense and compact. A tightly packed cup can contain noticeably more rice than a loosely filled cup—meaning more calories.

**Most accurate approach:** weigh your cooked rice. If you can’t, try to measure consistently (same cup, same scooping method).

### 2) Water absorption changes density
Different rice types absorb different amounts of water. More water absorption usually means **fewer calories per spoonful** (because there’s more water in the same volume), while drier rice tends to be **more calorie-dense per cup**.

### 3) Added ingredients change everything
Plain rice cooked in water is one thing. But these common additions can add up quickly:
- **Oil or butter** (even 1 teaspoon can add ~40 calories)
- **Coconut milk**
- **Fried rice cooking oil**
- **Sauces** (teriyaki, curry, creamy sauces)
- **Cheese**

If your “rice” includes any of the above, the calories may be much higher than the plain-cooked estimates.

### 4) Serving size creep is real
A “cup” of rice on a plate often turns into 1.5–2 cups without noticing—especially with bowls, takeout containers, or big scoops.

## How to track rice calories accurately (without overthinking it)

If you want a number you can trust, use one of these methods:

### Option A: Track cooked rice by weight (most consistent)
1. Cook rice as usual.
2. Weigh the portion you actually eat.
3. Log it as “cooked rice” by grams.

This avoids the “packed cup” issue and works well if you meal prep.

### Option B: Track dry rice, then divide (great for meal prep)
If you cook a batch:
1. Measure the **dry rice** you used.
2. Cook it.
3. Divide the cooked rice into equal portions.
4. Log calories based on the dry amount per portion.

Apps like **Eylo** make it easy to log meals and track your daily intake.

### Option C: Use the 1-cup estimate when you’re eating out
When you can’t weigh or measure, use a practical estimate:
- **1 cup cooked rice ≈ 200 calories**
- **2 cups cooked rice ≈ 400 calories**

It won’t be perfect, but it’s usually close enough to keep your weekly intake on track.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### How many calories are in 1 cup of rice cooked?
**About 200 calories** for most plain cooked rice. A common reference is **~205 calories for 1 cup cooked white rice**, while **brown rice is often ~215–220 calories** per cup. The exact number depends on rice type, how tightly it’s packed, and whether anything was added during cooking.

### How many calories are in 1 cup of uncooked white rice?
**About 650–700 calories** in **1 cup of uncooked (dry) white rice**. Dry rice is calorie-dense because it hasn’t absorbed water yet. After cooking, that same cup of dry rice typically turns into **about 3 cups cooked** (varies by rice type and cooking method), which is why cooked rice looks much “bigger” for the same calories.

### Is 1 cup cooked rice the same as 1 cup dry rice?
No. **1 cup dry rice is not the same as 1 cup cooked rice**. Dry rice expands a lot when cooked. As a rough guide:
- **1 cup dry white rice → ~3 cups cooked**
So if **1 cup cooked is ~200 calories**, then **1 cup dry** is roughly **3× that** (around **600+ calories**), depending on the rice and how it’s cooked.

### Does brown rice have fewer calories than white rice?
Not usually. **Brown rice is often slightly higher in calories per cooked cup** than white rice, but the difference is small. Brown rice tends to have **more fiber**, which many people find more filling, even if the calorie counts are similar.

### Do calories change if rice is cooked and cooled?
The calorie label doesn’t change, but cooling cooked rice can increase **resistant starch**, which may affect how your body digests it. For tracking purposes, it’s still best to **log it the same way** (by cooked weight or standard cooked serving).

## Quick reference: the simplest takeaway
If you want a dependable rule of thumb: **1 cup of plain cooked rice is about 200 calories**. If you need more precision, weigh your cooked portion or track the dry rice used for the batch—especially if you’re cooking with oil, butter, or rich sauces.
