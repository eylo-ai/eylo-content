To count your calories, you estimate how many calories your body needs per day, set a daily target based on your goal (maintain, lose, or gain), then track everything you eat and drink as accurately as you can—using nutrition labels, a food database, and (ideally) a kitchen scale—while reviewing weekly averages to adjust.

## Step 1: Set a calorie target that matches your goal

Calorie counting works best when you start with a realistic target—close enough that you can follow it consistently, and measurable enough that you can adjust it based on results.

### Understand the basics: BMR vs TDEE
- **BMR (Basal Metabolic Rate)**: calories your body uses at rest to keep you alive (breathing, circulation, etc.).
- **TDEE (Total Daily Energy Expenditure)**: your BMR *plus* daily movement and exercise—this is roughly your “maintenance calories.”

If you’re new to these terms, read [what is BMR for dummies](/articles/what-is-bmr-for-dummies). If you’re trying to decide what number to aim for, [what is a good TDEE for weight loss](/articles/what-is-a-good-tdee-for-weight-loss) helps you translate the concept into a practical target.

### Choose a target: maintain, lose, or gain
- **To maintain weight:** aim around your TDEE.
- **To lose weight:** aim below your TDEE (a “deficit”).
- **To gain weight:** aim above your TDEE (a “surplus”).

How big should the deficit be? Big deficits can be harder to stick to and can increase hunger. Many people start with a moderate reduction and adjust after 2–3 weeks based on progress.

## Step 2: Track your intake accurately (without making it miserable)

Accuracy matters most at the start. Once you learn your “usual” portions and meals, tracking gets faster.

### Use the best source for each food
1. **Packaged foods:** use the nutrition label.
   - Track **serving size** first (grams or pieces), then calories.
   - If you eat 2 servings, log 2 servings.
2. **Single-ingredient foods (rice, oats, chicken, fruit):** use a reliable database entry.
3. **Restaurant meals:** use the restaurant’s posted nutrition when available; otherwise choose the closest match and be consistent.

### Weigh foods when you can (especially calorie-dense ones)
A kitchen scale is the easiest way to reduce guesswork. Measuring cups are fine for some foods, but they’re less reliable for things like cereal, pasta, shredded cheese, nuts, and cooked grains.

High-impact foods to weigh:
- Oils, butter, nut butters
- Nuts/trail mix
- Cheese
- Rice/pasta/oats
- Meat portions

If you want an example of how specific foods can vary, see [how many calories are in 1 cup of rice cooked](/articles/how-many-calories-are-in-1-cup-of-rice-cooked). “One cup” can mean different things depending on how it’s scooped and how the rice was cooked.

### Don’t forget “hidden” calories
These are the most common tracking misses:
- Cooking oil (even “just a splash”)
- Creamer, sugar, syrups in coffee
- Sauces and dressings
- Alcohol
- Bites, tastes, and “just one” snacks

A good rule: if it has calories, it counts—log it, even if it’s small. Small things add up fast.

### Make tracking easier with routines
- **Repeat breakfasts/lunches** you enjoy.
- **Pre-log** your day in the morning so you’re not constantly “catching up.”
- **Build meals around protein + produce** (often more filling per calorie).
- **Use weekly averages** instead of obsessing over one day.

Apps like Eylo make it easy to log meals and track your daily intake.

## Step 3: Use weekly averages and adjust based on real results

Your body doesn’t “reset” at midnight. Water, sodium, stress, sleep, and digestion can swing scale weight day-to-day. That’s why calorie counting works best when you look at trends.

### Track these 3 things for 2–3 weeks
1. **Daily calories** (aim for consistency)
2. **Body weight trend** (weigh most mornings if you can, then look at the weekly average)
3. **Waist or progress photos** (optional but helpful)

### How to adjust your calories
After 2–3 consistent weeks:
- If you’re **not losing** and you want to lose: reduce calories slightly *or* increase activity.
- If you’re **losing faster than you want** and feel run down or overly hungry: add some calories back.
- If you’re **maintaining** and that’s your goal: keep going.

If you’re tempted to set a very low target, it’s worth reading [is 1200 calories a lot to eat in a day](/articles/is-1200-calories-a-lot-to-eat-in-a-day) to sanity-check whether that number fits your body and lifestyle. Also, if you’re comparing your target to your BMR, these explain the tradeoffs clearly:
- [should i eat less than my bmr to lose weight](/articles/should-i-eat-less-than-my-bmr-to-lose-weight)
- [how many calories should i eat if my bmr is 1500](/articles/how-many-calories-should-i-eat-if-my-bmr-is-1500)

### A simple “calorie counting accuracy” checklist
If results don’t match your expectations, these are the usual culprits:
- You’re not weighing calorie-dense foods
- You’re missing oils/sauces/drinks
- You’re relying on random database entries (instead of label/verified entries)
- Weekend intake is much higher than weekday intake
- Portions are creeping up over time

Fixing just one of those often gets things back on track.

## Step 4: Count calories in real life (home cooking, restaurants, and social events)

You don’t need perfection—you need a method you can repeat.

### Home-cooked meals: the easiest way to be accurate
For meals you cook:
- **Weigh ingredients** as you add them (especially oils, cheese, meat, grains).
- **Log the whole recipe**, then divide by servings.
- If you make the same meal often, save it as a custom recipe so it’s one-tap later.

Shortcut: If you don’t want to build recipes, weigh your portion and log the main ingredients (protein + carb + fat source) and accept a small margin of error.

### Restaurants: aim for “consistent and reasonable”
When you eat out:
- Choose a similar entry each time (don’t pick the lowest one just because it exists).
- If it’s a high-calorie meal (pizza, burgers, creamy pasta), assume it’s higher than you’d like and log accordingly.
- If you’re unsure, you can “buffer” by keeping the rest of the day simpler (lean protein, veggies, fruit).

### Social events: plan the day, not the moment
A practical approach:
- Eat a normal, protein-forward meal earlier so you don’t arrive starving.
- Decide what you actually want at the event (your favorite foods/drinks).
- Log your best estimate and move on—one meal doesn’t define your progress.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### How do I count my calories without a food scale?
Use nutrition labels and measuring cups/spoons, and prioritize estimating the foods that matter most: oils, nut butters, cheese, nuts, and grains. If you can only “upgrade” one habit, make it weighing calorie-dense foods a few times per week—those are where eyeballing is most likely to be off.

### What’s the most accurate way to estimate my maintenance calories (TDEE)?
The most accurate approach is: start with a calculator estimate, track your intake and weight trend for 2–3 weeks, then adjust based on what actually happens. For picking a calculator and understanding the tradeoffs, see [what is the most accurate tdee calculator](/articles/what-is-the-most-accurate-tdee-calculator).

### Do I need to eat my TDEE to lose weight?
No—eating at your TDEE generally maintains weight, while weight loss usually requires eating below it. The nuance is how far below, and how consistently you can stick to it. This breaks it down: [do i eat my tdee to lose weight](/articles/do-i-eat-my-tdee-to-lose-weight).

### Is 1200 calories a day a good target for counting calories?
Sometimes it can be appropriate for smaller bodies with lower energy needs, but for many people it’s hard to sustain and can backfire by increasing hunger and making adherence tougher. Use your TDEE, your results, and how you feel to choose a target, and sanity-check the number here: [is 1200 calories a lot to eat in a day](/articles/is-1200-calories-a-lot-to-eat-in-a-day).

### Should I eat less than my BMR to lose weight?
Many people can lose weight without going below BMR, because TDEE is higher than BMR. If your target is below BMR, it’s a sign the deficit may be aggressive for your current activity level and needs. For a practical explanation, read [should i eat less than my bmr to lose weight](/articles/should-i-eat-less-than-my-bmr-to-lose-weight).
