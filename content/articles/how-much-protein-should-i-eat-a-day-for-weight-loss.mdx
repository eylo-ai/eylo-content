For weight loss, a solid daily protein target for most people is **1.6–2.2 grams of protein per kilogram of body weight per day** (about **0.7–1.0 g per pound**), adjusted to your appetite, training, and how aggressive your calorie deficit is.

## A practical protein target (with quick examples)

If you want one number that works well for many dieters, aim for **~1.8 g/kg/day** and adjust from there.

**Examples (using 1.6–2.2 g/kg/day):**
- **70 kg (154 lb):** ~**110–155 g/day**
- **80 kg (176 lb):** ~**130–175 g/day**
- **90 kg (198 lb):** ~**145–200 g/day**

### When to choose the lower vs higher end
- **Choose ~1.6 g/kg** if you’re in a **small calorie deficit**, not lifting much, or you simply struggle to eat more protein consistently.
- **Choose ~2.0–2.2 g/kg** if you’re **leaner**, in a **bigger deficit**, doing **regular strength training**, or you notice hunger and muscle loss are issues during dieting.

### Prefer goal weight if you have a lot to lose
If you have significant weight to lose, using current body weight can overshoot. A simple workaround is to base protein on a **goal weight** (or an “estimated leaner weight”), then land in the same 1.6–2.2 g/kg range.

## Why higher protein helps with weight loss (without magic)

Protein supports weight loss mainly because it makes dieting easier and helps protect what you want to keep.

### 1) It helps preserve muscle in a calorie deficit
When calories drop, your body can lose both fat and lean mass. **Adequate protein + resistance training** is one of the best combos for keeping more muscle while you lose fat. Keeping muscle tends to help performance, shape, and can make maintenance easier later.

### 2) It improves fullness and reduces “snack drift”
Protein is consistently linked with greater satiety than carbs or fats for many people. If you’re trying to figure out meals that keep you full while dieting, pair protein with high-volume foods (veg, fruit, soups, legumes). For ideas, see [what is filling but low in calories](/articles/what-is-filling-but-low-in-calories).

### 3) It makes your calorie target easier to stick to
Weight loss still comes down to a calorie deficit, but protein can make that deficit feel less miserable. If you’re unsure what deficit to aim for, start with [what calories should i eat to lose weight](/articles/what-calories-should-i-eat-to-lose-weight) and refine from there.

## How to hit your protein target without overthinking it

### Spread protein across the day
A simple approach: **25–40 g protein per meal**, 3–4 times per day (depending on your target). This tends to work well for appetite and makes it easier to reach your daily total.

**Example day (~140 g protein):**
- Breakfast: 30–35 g  
- Lunch: 35–40 g  
- Dinner: 40–50 g  
- Snack: 15–25 g  

### Build meals around “protein anchors”
Pick one main protein source per meal, then add carbs/fats around it:
- Chicken/turkey, lean beef, fish, eggs/egg whites
- Greek yogurt, cottage cheese
- Tofu/tempeh, edamame, lentils/beans (often easier if combined with other protein sources)
- Protein powders can help, but whole foods make it easier to stay full

### Use a simple tracking method for consistency
If you’re already counting calories, tracking protein is just one more number—and it often improves results because it nudges meal choices. Apps like **Eylo** make it easy to log meals and track your daily intake.

- [how do i calculate my intake of calories](/articles/how-do-i-calculate-my-intake-of-calories)

### Don’t let carbs crowd out protein
Carbs aren’t “bad,” but they can push protein off your plate if you’re not intentional—especially with calorie-dense staples. If rice is a frequent side for you, it can help to learn portions like [how many calories are in 1 cup of rice cooked](/articles/how-many-calories-are-in-1-cup-of-rice-cooked) so you can budget room for a solid protein serving.

## Common mistakes (and easy fixes)

### Mistake 1: Going very low calorie and hoping protein “covers it”
If calories are too low, hunger, fatigue, and muscle loss risk go up—even with high protein. If you’re tempted to slash calories hard, read [is 1200 calories a lot to eat in a day](/articles/is-1200-calories-a-lot-to-eat-in-a-day) and consider a more sustainable deficit.

### Mistake 2: Only “protein loading” at dinner
Eating 10–15 g at breakfast and trying to cram 90 g at night is doable, but it’s harder on appetite and consistency. Fix: add an easy morning protein (Greek yogurt, eggs, tofu scramble, cottage cheese, a shake).

### Mistake 3: Ignoring strength training
Protein helps more when you give your body a reason to keep muscle. Even **2–4 short resistance sessions per week** can make a noticeable difference during a cut.

### Mistake 4: Assuming more is always better
Past a point, extra protein isn’t harmful for most healthy people, but it can crowd out fiber-rich foods (veg, fruit, whole grains, beans) that help fullness and digestion. Aim for your target, not perfection.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### ### How much protein should i eat a day for weight loss?
A good daily target for weight loss is **1.6–2.2 g/kg/day (0.7–1.0 g/lb/day)**. Use the lower end if your deficit is mild and the higher end if you’re leaner, dieting harder, or lifting regularly.

### ### What calories should i eat to lose weight?
Most people lose weight by eating **below their TDEE** (total daily energy expenditure). A common starting point is a **300–500 calorie/day deficit**, then adjust based on progress over 2–4 weeks. This guide walks through it: [what calories should i eat to lose weight](/articles/what-calories-should-i-eat-to-lose-weight).

### ### How do i calculate my intake of calories?
Estimate your maintenance calories (TDEE), then subtract a manageable deficit and monitor results. If you want a step-by-step method, use [how do i calculate my intake of calories](/articles/how-do-i-calculate-my-intake-of-calories).

### ### Is 1200 calories a lot to eat in a day?
For many adults, **1200 calories is quite low**, especially if you’re active, taller, or trying to maintain muscle while losing fat. It may be appropriate for some people in specific situations, but it often makes consistency harder. More context here: [is 1200 calories a lot to eat in a day](/articles/is-1200-calories-a-lot-to-eat-in-a-day).
