To calculate your calorie intake, add up the calories from everything you eat and drink in a day using nutrition labels, a food database, and accurate portion sizes (ideally by weighing foods), then compare that total to your estimated daily calorie needs (your TDEE) to see whether you’re in a deficit, at maintenance, or in a surplus.

## Step 1: Figure out your daily calorie “budget” (TDEE)

Before you total what you eat, it helps to know what you’re aiming for. Most people use **TDEE** (Total Daily Energy Expenditure) as their baseline—roughly how many calories you burn per day including normal activity and exercise.

**A simple way to estimate TDEE:**
1. Estimate your **BMR** (Basal Metabolic Rate): calories your body uses at rest.
2. Multiply by an **activity factor** to account for movement and exercise.

If you want a deeper explanation of the terms, start with [what is BMR for dummies](/articles/what-is-bmr-for-dummies). If you’re choosing a calculator, [what is the most accurate TDEE calculator](/articles/what-is-the-most-accurate-tdee-calculator) can help you pick a good method.

**Common activity multipliers (rough guide):**
- Sedentary (little exercise): **BMR × 1.2**
- Lightly active (1–3 days/week): **BMR × 1.375**
- Moderately active (3–5 days/week): **BMR × 1.55**
- Very active (6–7 days/week): **BMR × 1.725**

**Example:**  
If your BMR is 1500 and you’re lightly active:  
1500 × 1.375 ≈ **2060 calories/day** (estimated maintenance)

If you want examples tied to a specific BMR, see [how many calories should i eat if my bmr is 1500](/articles/how-many-calories-should-i-eat-if-my-bmr-is-1500).

**Then decide your goal:**
- **Maintain weight:** eat around your TDEE (with normal day-to-day variation)
- **Lose weight:** eat below TDEE (a moderate deficit is usually easier to sustain)
- **Gain weight:** eat above TDEE

If you’re unsure whether you should “eat your TDEE” or go below it, [do i eat my tdee to lose weight](/articles/do-i-eat-my-tdee-to-lose-weight) breaks down the logic.

## Step 2: Track what you eat (the part most people underestimate)

Your “calorie intake” is simply the **sum of calories consumed**. The challenge is accuracy. These steps make a big difference:

### Use the best source for calorie numbers
Use this order of preference:
1. **Nutrition label** (for packaged foods)
2. **Restaurant nutrition info** (if available)
3. **Verified entries** in a reputable database (for whole foods and recipes)

When using databases, watch for entries that look “too good to be true” (like a bagel listed as 120 calories). Cross-check with another entry if something seems off.

For a full walkthrough, [how do i count my calories](/articles/how-do-i-count-my-calories) covers the day-to-day mechanics.

### Measure portions accurately (this is the biggest lever)
Portion errors can easily swing your daily total by hundreds of calories.

**Most accurate:** a digital food scale  
- Weigh foods in **grams** when possible.
- For calorie-dense foods (oil, nut butter, cheese, granola), weighing matters a lot.

**Next best:** measuring cups/spoons  
- Helpful for liquids and some staples, but less accurate for foods that pack differently (cereal, shredded cheese).

**Least accurate:** eyeballing  
- Fine once you’ve built experience, but it’s the easiest way to undercount.

### Don’t forget “invisible” calories
These are common misses:
- Cooking oils and butter (1 tbsp oil is often ~120 calories)
- Cream/sugar in coffee
- Sauces and dressings
- “Bites, tastes, and samples”
- Alcohol
- Snacks while cooking

A quick habit: if it has calories, log it—even if it’s small. Small items add up fast.

### Log consistently (and make it easy)
Consistency beats perfection. If you’re tracking most days and most meals, you’ll learn what drives your intake.

Apps like Eylo make it easy to log meals and track your daily intake.

## Step 3: Calculate calories for meals, recipes, and common foods

### Packaged foods: use the label correctly
Key things to check:
- **Serving size** (and whether you ate more than one serving)
- **Calories per serving**
- Whether the label lists **prepared vs. dry** (important for foods like pasta, rice, oats)

### Whole foods: use a database + weight
For foods like chicken, rice, potatoes, fruit:
- Weigh the portion (grams)
- Use a database entry that matches the state (raw vs cooked)

Example: rice can vary a lot depending on whether you log it dry or cooked. If you want a concrete reference point, [how many calories are in 1 cup of rice cooked](/articles/how-many-calories-are-in-1-cup-of-rice-cooked) shows typical numbers and what changes them.

### Recipes: add ingredients, then divide by portions
For homemade meals (chili, pasta bake, curry), the most reliable method is:

1. **Log every ingredient** (including oil, sauces, cheese)
2. **Total the recipe calories**
3. **Divide by the number of servings**  
   - Better: divide by **total cooked weight** and log by grams (more accurate if serving sizes vary)

**Example (simple):**
- Total recipe: 1800 calories
- You portion it into 4 equal containers  
→ **450 calories per serving**

**Example (more accurate):**
- Total cooked weight: 1200 g  
→ 1800 ÷ 1200 = **1.5 calories per gram**  
If you eat 350 g: 350 × 1.5 = **525 calories**

## Step 4: Sanity-check your intake and adjust using real results

Even with careful tracking, calorie counts are estimates:
- Labels can legally be off by a margin.
- Restaurant meals vary.
- Your activity level changes week to week.
- Water retention can mask fat loss on the scale.

A practical way to “calibrate”:
1. Track intake for **2–4 weeks**
2. Weigh yourself **several mornings per week** (look at the trend, not one day)
3. Compare expected vs actual change

**If your weight trend isn’t moving as expected:**
- First, tighten tracking (weigh more foods, log oils/sauces, reduce “guestimates”)
- Then adjust calories slightly (often 100–200 calories/day) and reassess after 2 weeks

If your goal is aggressive loss and you’re trying to estimate a target deficit, [how many calories do i need to lose 2 pounds a week](/articles/how-many-calories-do-i-need-to-lose-2-pounds-a-week) explains the math and the tradeoffs.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### How do I calculate my intake of calories?
Add up the calories from each food and drink you consume in a day by:
- Using labels or a reliable database for calorie values
- Measuring portions (preferably by weight)
- Including cooking fats, sauces, drinks, and snacks  
Your daily intake is the total sum. If you want it to be meaningful for a goal, compare it to your estimated TDEE.

### Is 1200 calories a lot to eat in a day?
It depends on your body size, activity level, and goals—1200 can be low for many adults, especially if you’re active. A better approach is to estimate your TDEE and choose a deficit that feels sustainable. For context and examples, see [is 1200 calories a lot to eat in a day](/articles/is-1200-calories-a-lot-to-eat-in-a-day).

### Do I eat my TDEE to lose weight?
Not usually—**TDEE is your estimated maintenance**, so weight loss generally requires eating below it. Some people cycle calories (higher on training days, lower on rest days), but the weekly average still matters most. This is explained in [do i eat my tdee to lose weight](/articles/do-i-eat-my-tdee-to-lose-weight).

### What is a good TDEE for weight loss?
There isn’t one “good” TDEE—TDEE is an estimate of what you burn. For weight loss, you typically set your intake **below your TDEE** by a moderate amount and adjust based on results. If you want help choosing a target, [what is a good tdee for weight loss](/articles/what-is-a-good-tdee-for-weight-loss) walks through practical ranges.

### Should I eat less than my BMR to lose weight?
BMR is what you’d burn at rest; most people compare intake to **TDEE**, not BMR, because you’re not actually resting all day. Very low intakes can be hard to sustain and may increase hunger and fatigue. For a clearer explanation, see [should i eat less than my bmr to lose weight](/articles/should-i-eat-less-than-my-bmr-to-lose-weight).
