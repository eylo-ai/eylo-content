A good TDEE for weight loss is your *actual* maintenance calories (the amount that keeps your weight stable) minus a sustainable deficit—typically about 10–25% below maintenance, or roughly 250–750 calories per day for many people—adjusted based on your weekly progress, hunger, training, and energy.

## Start with your real maintenance (TDEE), not a “perfect” number

**TDEE (Total Daily Energy Expenditure)** is the total calories you burn in a day from resting metabolism, movement, exercise, and digestion. For weight loss, the goal isn’t to find a universally “good” TDEE—it’s to find *your* maintenance level and then create a deficit you can stick to.

**How to estimate your TDEE:**
- **Use a calculator as a starting point**, then validate it with real data. Calculators can be close, but they’re still estimates. If you want help choosing one, see [what is the most accurate tdee calculator](/articles/what-is-the-most-accurate-tdee-calculator).
- **Track intake and weight for 2–3 weeks**:
  - Weigh yourself daily (same conditions), then compare weekly averages.
  - If your weekly average weight is flat, your average intake is close to maintenance.
  - If weight is rising, you’re above maintenance; if falling, you’re below.

**Quick reality check:** Your TDEE can shift with changes in activity, sleep, stress, and body weight. So “good” is less about a single number and more about a number you can *update* as your body changes.

## Pick a deficit that matches your lifestyle (10–25% is a solid range)

Once you have a maintenance estimate, choose a deficit that you can maintain without feeling wrecked.

**Common deficit options:**
- **10% deficit:** Best for people who are already lean, very active, or hate feeling hungry. Slower loss, often easier adherence.
- **15–20% deficit:** A practical “middle” that works for many people.
- **25% deficit:** Faster loss, but more likely to increase hunger, reduce training performance, and trigger diet fatigue.

**Example math (using percentages):**
- Maintenance (TDEE) = 2,200 calories  
  - 10% deficit → ~1,980/day  
  - 20% deficit → ~1,760/day  
  - 25% deficit → ~1,650/day  

**Example math (using a fixed deficit):**
- Maintenance (TDEE) = 2,200 calories  
  - minus 300 → 1,900/day (gentle)  
  - minus 500 → 1,700/day (moderate)  
  - minus 700 → 1,500/day (aggressive for many)

**How fast should weight loss be?**  
A commonly used target is about **0.5–1% of body weight per week**, but the “right” pace depends on your starting point, training goals, and how you feel. If you’re consistently exhausted, ravenous, or your workouts crash, your deficit is probably too steep.

**A simple adjustment rule (weekly):**
- Losing **faster than intended** → add 100–200 calories/day.
- Losing **slower than intended** (or not at all for 2–3 weeks) → reduce 100–200 calories/day *or* increase steps/activity.
- Weight fluctuating day-to-day is normal—use **weekly averages**.

## Don’t confuse TDEE with BMR (and don’t race to the bottom)

**BMR (Basal Metabolic Rate)** is what you’d burn at rest. **TDEE is higher** because it includes daily movement and exercise. Weight loss calories are usually **below TDEE**, but not necessarily below BMR—and pushing too low often backfires through poor adherence, low energy, and reduced activity.

If you want a clearer breakdown of what BMR is and how it fits into the bigger picture, read [what is bmr for dummies](/articles/what-is-bmr-for-dummies) and [what is a good bmr to have](/articles/what-is-a-good-bmr-to-have).

**Should you eat less than your BMR?**  
Some people end up there temporarily depending on size and activity, but it’s not a great “goal” to chase. A better approach is:  
1) estimate maintenance, 2) choose a reasonable deficit, 3) monitor results and how you feel. For more context, see [should i eat less than my bmr to lose weight](/articles/should-i-eat-less-than-my-bmr-to-lose-weight).

**Practical guardrails that often help:**
- If your calorie target makes you constantly think about food, it’s probably too low.
- If your step count or general movement drops because you’re tired, your “deficit on paper” may shrink in real life.
- If you can’t keep it up for weeks, it’s not a good deficit—even if it’s mathematically “correct.”

Apps like Eylo make it easy to log meals and track your daily intake.

## Make your “good TDEE for weight loss” work in real meals

Even with the right calorie target, results depend on how consistently you can hit it. A few tactics make a deficit feel easier:

**1) Build meals around protein + high-volume foods**
- Protein and fiber tend to improve fullness per calorie.
- Add volume with vegetables, fruit, soups, and legumes.

**2) Watch calorie-dense “small foods”**
A handful of nuts, oils, sauces, and sugary drinks can quietly erase a deficit.

**3) Use familiar portions to stay consistent**
If you eat staples often, learn their calorie ranges. For example, rice is a common “calorie creep” food—see [how many calories are in 1 cup of rice cooked](/articles/how-many-calories-are-in-1-cup-of-rice-cooked).

**4) Keep activity steady**
When calories drop, people often move less without noticing. Keeping steps consistent (or adding a small step goal) helps your TDEE estimate stay stable.

**5) Recalculate as you lose weight**
As body weight decreases, TDEE usually decreases too. If fat loss stalls after months of progress, it may simply be time for a small adjustment.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### What is a good TDEE for weight loss?
A good TDEE for weight loss is your maintenance calories (your true TDEE) minus a sustainable deficit—often 10–25% below maintenance. The “good” number is the one that produces steady weekly progress while you can still function well, sleep, and keep activity/training consistent.

### Should I eat less than my BMR to lose weight?
Usually, it’s more practical to aim below **TDEE** rather than fixating on **BMR**. Eating below BMR can happen depending on your size and activity, but it often makes adherence harder and can reduce daily movement. More detail here: [should i eat less than my bmr to lose weight](/articles/should-i-eat-less-than-my-bmr-to-lose-weight).

### How many calories should I eat if my BMR is 1500?
A BMR of 1500 doesn’t automatically mean you should eat 1500. Your weight-loss target depends on your activity level (which determines TDEE). A common approach is to estimate TDEE from BMR and activity, then subtract 10–25%. A walkthrough is here: [how many calories should i eat if my bmr is 1500](/articles/how-many-calories-should-i-eat-if-my-bmr-is-1500).

### What is the most accurate TDEE calculator?
No calculator is perfect because real-life activity and metabolism vary, but some formulas and inputs tend to be more reliable than others. The most accurate approach is: calculator estimate → track intake and weight trends → adjust. See [what is the most accurate tdee calculator](/articles/what-is-the-most-accurate-tdee-calculator).

### What is a good BMR to have?
There isn’t a universally “good” BMR—higher or lower mostly reflects body size, lean mass, age, and sex. For weight loss, BMR is useful for understanding your baseline burn, but your day-to-day target should be built from TDEE. More here: [what is a good bmr to have](/articles/what-is-a-good-bmr-to-have).
