If your BMR is 1500 calories/day, you’ll typically want to eat **more than 1500** to maintain your weight—because BMR is what you’d burn at rest, not what you burn in a normal day. A practical starting point is to estimate your **TDEE (total daily energy expenditure)** by multiplying 1500 by an activity factor: **~1800 (sedentary)**, **~2050 (lightly active)**, **~2325 (moderately active)**, **~2580 (very active)**. From there, adjust based on your goal: **maintain = around TDEE**, **lose weight = ~250–500 calories below TDEE**, **gain = ~250–500 above TDEE**.

## BMR vs. TDEE: what your 1500 number actually means

**BMR (Basal Metabolic Rate)** is the energy your body uses to keep you alive at rest—breathing, circulation, temperature regulation, basic organ function. It’s not a target to “eat up to,” and it’s not a full-day burn estimate unless you literally stayed in bed all day.

**TDEE** includes:
- Your BMR  
- Daily movement (walking, chores, fidgeting—often called NEAT)  
- Exercise  
- Digestion (thermic effect of food)

So if your BMR is 1500, your TDEE is almost always higher. How much higher depends mostly on how much you move.

If you want a quick refresher on what BMR is and what it isn’t, see [what is bmr for dummies](/articles/what-is-bmr-for-dummies). If you’re wondering whether your number is “good,” [what is a good bmr to have](/articles/what-is-a-good-bmr-to-have) can help frame it.

## Estimate your maintenance calories (TDEE) from a 1500 BMR

A common way to estimate TDEE is:

**TDEE ≈ BMR × activity factor**

Here are useful activity factors (choose the one that best matches your average week, not your “best week”):

- **Sedentary (little structured exercise; mostly sitting):** 1.2  
- **Lightly active (some walking; 1–3 workouts/week):** 1.375  
- **Moderately active (more daily movement; 3–5 workouts/week):** 1.55  
- **Very active (hard training most days; active job):** 1.725  

With **BMR = 1500**, that gives:

| Activity level | Multiplier | Estimated TDEE (maintenance) |
|---|---:|---:|
| Sedentary | 1.2 | **1800** |
| Lightly active | 1.375 | **2060** |
| Moderately active | 1.55 | **2325** |
| Very active | 1.725 | **2585** |

**How to pick the right row:**  
If you sit most of the day and average under ~6,000 steps, “sedentary” is often closest even if you work out a couple times per week. If you’re consistently walking a lot (8,000–12,000 steps) plus training, “moderately active” may fit better.

## Choose a calorie target based on your goal (with examples)

Once you have a maintenance estimate, you can set a target. These ranges are intentionally conservative because they’re easier to stick to and easier to adjust.

### If your goal is to maintain weight
Start around your estimated **TDEE** and hold it for **2–3 weeks**, watching your average scale trend (not day-to-day fluctuations).

- Example: BMR 1500, lightly active → TDEE ~2060  
  - Maintenance target: **~2000–2100/day**

### If your goal is fat loss
A common starting deficit is **~250–500 calories/day** below TDEE.

- Example A (sedentary): TDEE ~1800  
  - Fat-loss target: **~1300–1550/day**
- Example B (moderately active): TDEE ~2325  
  - Fat-loss target: **~1825–2075/day**

If you’re tempted to go much lower, read [should i eat less than my bmr to lose weight](/articles/should-i-eat-less-than-my-bmr-to-lose-weight) for the tradeoffs and why “as low as possible” often backfires (hunger, low energy, poor adherence).

### If your goal is muscle gain/weight gain
Aim for **~250–500 calories/day** above TDEE.

- Example: TDEE ~2060  
  - Gain target: **~2300–2550/day**

### How to adjust if the scale doesn’t move the way you expect
Use a simple feedback loop:
1. Pick a target from the ranges above.
2. Track **daily weigh-ins** (or 3–4x/week) and look at the **weekly average**.
3. After **2–3 weeks**:
   - If maintaining but trending up/down: adjust by **~100–200 calories/day**
   - If losing too fast or feeling wrecked: add **~100–200/day**
   - If not losing at all: subtract **~100–200/day** or increase steps

Apps like **Eylo** make it easy to log meals and track your daily intake.

## Make your calorie target easier to hit (without feeling miserable)

Calories are the “budget,” but food choices determine how livable the budget feels. A few practical levers:

### 1) Prioritize protein and fiber at most meals
This tends to improve fullness per calorie and helps keep meals satisfying when you’re in a deficit. Easy wins:
- Greek yogurt or cottage cheese
- Eggs + egg whites
- Chicken, tuna, lean beef, tofu/tempeh
- Beans/lentils + veggies

### 2) Watch calorie-dense “small” foods
Some foods don’t look like much but can eat up a big chunk of your day:
- Oils, butter, creamy dressings
- Nuts/nut butters
- Sugary drinks, fancy coffees
- Alcohol

You don’t need to ban them—just measure occasionally so your “mental math” stays honest.

### 3) Use a few “anchor meals” you repeat
If breakfast and lunch are predictable, dinner can be flexible without blowing your target. For example:
- A high-protein breakfast you like
- A lunch bowl/salad you can rotate
- A snack you can rely on (fruit + yogurt, protein shake, etc.)

### 4) Learn a couple of staple calorie references
Knowing a few common foods helps you build meals quickly. For instance, if rice is a regular for you, [how many calories are in 1 cup of rice cooked](/articles/how-many-calories-are-in-1-cup-of-rice-cooked) is a handy reference when you’re portioning meals.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### How many calories should I eat if my BMR is 1500?
Most people with a 1500 BMR maintain somewhere around **1800–2600 calories/day**, depending on activity. A reasonable fat-loss target is often **~250–500 below your TDEE**, and a gain target is **~250–500 above**. If you’re unsure, start with the “lightly active” estimate (~2060) and adjust after 2–3 weeks based on your weight trend and hunger/energy.

### Should I eat less than my BMR to lose weight?
Sometimes a fat-loss calorie target can land below your BMR number on paper—especially if you’re sedentary—but that doesn’t automatically mean it’s a good idea. Many people do better aiming for a moderate deficit from TDEE and using movement (steps, training) to widen the gap, rather than pushing food extremely low. More context here: [should i eat less than my bmr to lose weight](/articles/should-i-eat-less-than-my-bmr-to-lose-weight).

### What is BMR for dummies?
BMR is the calories your body burns doing the basics to stay alive if you were resting all day. It’s not the same as maintenance calories, because real life includes walking, working, exercising, and digesting food. A simple breakdown is in [what is bmr for dummies](/articles/what-is-bmr-for-dummies).

### What is the most accurate TDEE calculator?
No calculator is perfect because NEAT (your day-to-day movement) varies a lot, and people often misjudge activity level. The most accurate approach is: use a calculator to get a starting estimate, then “calibrate” it using 2–3 weeks of consistent tracking and weight trends. If you want to compare methods and accuracy, see [what is the most accurate tdee calculator](/articles/what-is-the-most-accurate-tdee-calculator).
