To lose weight, aim to eat **about 10–25% fewer calories than your maintenance calories (your TDEE)**—for many people that’s roughly a **250–750 calorie/day deficit**, adjusted based on your size, activity level, and how fast you want results.

## Step 1: Find your maintenance calories (TDEE)

Your **TDEE (Total Daily Energy Expenditure)** is the number of calories you burn on an average day, including movement and exercise. Weight loss is mostly about creating a consistent calorie deficit *relative to this number*.

A practical way to estimate TDEE:

1. Estimate your **BMR** (basal metabolic rate): calories your body uses at rest.
2. Multiply by an activity factor to get TDEE.

Common activity multipliers:
- **Sedentary (little exercise):** BMR × 1.2  
- **Lightly active (1–3 days/week):** BMR × 1.375  
- **Moderately active (3–5 days/week):** BMR × 1.55  
- **Very active (6–7 days/week):** BMR × 1.725  

If you want the full walkthrough, use: [how do i calculate my intake of calories](/articles/how-do-i-calculate-my-intake-of-calories) and for deeper clarity on the terms: [what is bmr for dummies](/articles/what-is-bmr-for-dummies).

**Reality check:** TDEE calculators are estimates. Your real maintenance is the calorie intake where your weight trend stays roughly stable over 2–4 weeks.

## Step 2: Choose a calorie deficit that matches your goal (and your life)

Once you have a TDEE estimate, pick a deficit you can sustain while still eating enough to feel okay and perform well.

### A simple deficit guide
- **Small deficit (10–15% below TDEE):** slower loss, often easier to stick to  
- **Moderate deficit (15–25% below TDEE):** solid pace for many people  
- **Aggressive deficit (25%+ below TDEE):** harder, more hunger/fatigue risk, more likely to backfire

### What that looks like in numbers
If your TDEE is **2,200 calories/day**:
- 10% deficit → ~**1,980/day**
- 20% deficit → ~**1,760/day**
- 25% deficit → ~**1,650/day**

If you’re aiming for a specific weekly rate, this helps: [how many calories do i need to lose 2 pounds a week](/articles/how-many-calories-do-i-need-to-lose-2-pounds-a-week). And if you’re unsure whether you should “eat at TDEE” or below it, this clarifies the concept: [do i eat my tdee to lose weight](/articles/do-i-eat-my-tdee-to-lose-weight).

### How fast should you try to lose?
A common, practical target is **~0.5–1% of body weight per week**. Faster isn’t always “better”—it can increase hunger, reduce training performance, and make it harder to keep the weight off.

## Step 3: Set your daily calorie target (and make it workable)

After you choose a deficit, turn it into a daily target you can actually follow.

### Use a weekly average, not perfection
Your body doesn’t “reset” at midnight. Many people do better aiming for a **weekly calorie budget**:

- Daily target × 7 = weekly target  
- You can eat a bit more on social days and a bit less on quieter days, as long as the weekly average stays on track.

### Track intake consistently (without getting obsessive)
Accuracy matters most with the foods that are easiest to underestimate:
- Cooking oils, butter, dressings
- Nuts/nut butters
- Cheese
- “Healthy” snacks (granola, trail mix)
- Restaurant meals

If you’re new to tracking, this is the most useful starting point: [how do i count my calories](/articles/how-do-i-count-my-calories). Apps like **Eylo** make it easy to log meals and track your daily intake.

### Prioritize what makes a deficit easier
You don’t need a perfect macro split, but these habits tend to make calorie targets feel less painful:

- **Protein at most meals** (helps fullness and supports muscle when dieting)
- **High-fiber foods** (vegetables, fruit, beans, whole grains)
- **Mostly minimally processed foods** (often more filling per calorie)
- **Plan “default meals”** you can repeat on busy days

A quick example day that often works well:
- Breakfast: Greek yogurt + berries + oats  
- Lunch: Chicken/beans + big salad + rice or potatoes  
- Snack: Fruit + cottage cheese  
- Dinner: Stir-fry with lean protein + lots of veg + measured carbs

(And yes, measuring staples helps—like rice. If you’re curious about a common portion: [how many calories are in 1 cup of rice cooked](/articles/how-many-calories-are-in-1-cup-of-rice-cooked).)

## Step 4: Adjust based on results (your body is the real calculator)

After you start your calorie target, give it **2–3 weeks** before making big changes. Scale weight is noisy—water, sodium, stress, sleep, and workouts can mask fat loss.

### How to assess progress
- Weigh yourself **3–7 mornings/week**, then use the **weekly average**
- Compare **weekly averages** over time (trend > single weigh-in)
- Also watch: waist measurements, how clothes fit, gym performance, hunger/energy

### When to adjust calories
- **If you’re losing faster than intended** (and feel run down): add **100–200/day**
- **If you’re not losing after ~3 weeks**: subtract **100–200/day** *or* increase steps/activity
- **If weekends wipe out weekdays**: keep weekdays similar, but set a **planned weekend budget**

## Frequently Asked Questions

### What calories should I eat to lose weight?
Start with your **TDEE**, then eat **10–25% below it**. If you don’t know your TDEE yet, estimate it, pick a moderate deficit, and adjust after 2–3 weeks based on your weight trend.

### Is 1200 calories a lot to eat in a day?
For many adults, **1,200 calories is relatively low**, especially if you’re active or larger-bodied, and it can be hard to meet protein/fiber needs and feel satisfied. Whether it’s “a lot” depends on your maintenance calories and your context—use this guide: [is 1200 calories a lot to eat in a day](/articles/is-1200-calories-a-lot-to-eat-in-a-day).

### Do I eat my TDEE to lose weight?
No—**TDEE is maintenance**, so eating at TDEE generally maintains weight. To lose weight, you typically eat **below TDEE** (or increase activity so your TDEE rises while intake stays the same). More here: [do i eat my tdee to lose weight](/articles/do-i-eat-my-tdee-to-lose-weight).

### How many calories do I need to lose 2 pounds a week?
Losing **2 lb/week** usually requires a large deficit (often around **1,000 calories/day** on average), which can be tough to sustain and may not be appropriate for everyone. This breakdown shows how to estimate it from your numbers: [how many calories do i need to lose 2 pounds a week](/articles/how-many-calories-do-i-need-to-lose-2-pounds-a-week).

### What is the most accurate TDEE calculator?
No calculator is perfect; the “most accurate” one is the one you **validate against your real-world weight trend**. Use a reputable calculator to get a starting estimate, then adjust based on 2–4 weeks of consistent tracking. If you want a comparison of methods, see: [what is the most accurate tdee calculator](/articles/what-is-the-most-accurate-tdee-calculator).
