To lose **2 pounds per week**, you generally need a **~1,000-calorie daily deficit** (because 2 lb × ~3,500 calories per lb ≈ 7,000 calories per week, and 7,000 ÷ 7 days ≈ 1,000 per day). In practice, that means you’d estimate your **TDEE** (the calories you burn in a day) and aim to eat about **TDEE − 1,000** on average—though for many people, a full 1,000-calorie deficit every day can be hard to sustain and may push intake too low.

## The math behind “2 pounds a week” (and why it’s an estimate)

The “3,500 calories per pound” rule is a useful shortcut, but real weight loss isn’t perfectly linear. Your scale weight changes week to week due to:

- **Water retention** (salt, carbs, stress, menstrual cycle)
- **Glycogen changes** (stored carbs in muscle/liver hold water)
- **Digestion** (food volume and timing)
- **Adaptive responses** (as you lose weight, you burn fewer calories)

So think of the 1,000-calorie deficit as a **starting target**, not a guarantee.

### What a 1,000-calorie deficit looks like

If your **TDEE is 2,600**, then:
- Target for ~2 lb/week: **~1,600 calories/day**

If your **TDEE is 2,100**, then:
- Target for ~2 lb/week: **~1,100 calories/day** (often unrealistic for most adults)

That’s why the first step is getting a decent TDEE estimate, and the second step is checking whether the resulting calorie target is actually livable.

If you want a deeper explanation of how TDEE works for fat loss, read: [what is a good tdee for weight loss](/articles/what-is-a-good-tdee-for-weight-loss) and [do i eat my tdee to lose weight](/articles/do-i-eat-my-tdee-to-lose-weight).

## Step-by-step: calculate your calories for 2 lb/week

### 1) Estimate your TDEE
TDEE is your **total daily energy expenditure**—your baseline needs plus activity. You can estimate it with a calculator, then refine it using real-world results. If you’re comparing tools, this helps: [what is the most accurate tdee calculator](/articles/what-is-the-most-accurate-tdee-calculator).

### 2) Subtract 1,000 calories/day (then sanity-check it)
- **Goal intake = TDEE − 1,000** (for ~2 lb/week)

Sanity-check questions:
- Does this put you **below your BMR** (your “keep the lights on” calories)?
- Does it feel so low you can’t hit protein, fiber, and basic nutrition?
- Does it trigger rebound eating on weekends?

If your calculated target is extremely low, a more sustainable approach is often:
- **500–750 calorie deficit/day** (roughly ~1–1.5 lb/week for many people), or  
- A **mixed approach**: smaller food deficit + more activity.

If you’re unsure how BMR fits in, start here: [what is bmr for dummies](/articles/what-is-bmr-for-dummies).

### 3) Use a weekly average, not a perfect daily number
You don’t have to hit the exact same calories daily. Many people do better with a weekly budget:

- 1,000/day deficit × 7 days = **7,000/week deficit**
- You could distribute that as:
  - Slightly higher calories on training/social days
  - Slightly lower calories on quieter days

The key is the **average**.

### 4) Validate with 2–3 weeks of data
Track:
- Your **average daily calories**
- Your **morning weigh-ins** (look at weekly averages)
- Your **trend** over 2–3 weeks

If the trend is slower than expected, adjust by **100–200 calories/day** or add a bit of activity. If it’s faster and you feel run-down or ravenous, increase calories slightly.

## When 2 pounds per week is (and isn’t) a good idea

A 2 lb/week pace can be reasonable for some people—especially those with more weight to lose—because a 1,000-calorie deficit may still leave enough food for good nutrition. But for others, it can backfire.

### Signs your calorie target may be too aggressive
- Constant hunger that doesn’t improve after the first 1–2 weeks
- Frequent “blowouts” after trying to be perfect
- Training performance dropping hard
- Sleep getting worse
- You’re relying on ultra-low-calorie days to “make up” for normal eating

This doesn’t mean you’re doing anything wrong—it usually means the deficit is too steep for your current body size, lifestyle, or stress load.

### A practical alternative: aim for the biggest deficit you can repeat
Many people get better results long-term with:
- **High-protein meals**
- **Higher-fiber carbs** and plenty of produce
- **Strength training** (to support muscle retention)
- **Daily steps** as a low-friction calorie burn

Apps like **Eylo** make it easy to log meals and track your daily intake.

## How to make a 1,000-calorie deficit feel doable (without feeling miserable)

If you try for 2 lb/week, the biggest challenge is usually **hunger management** and **diet fatigue**. These tactics help the deficit “feel smaller”:

### Build meals around protein + produce
A simple template:
- **1–2 palms of protein** (chicken, fish, lean beef, tofu, Greek yogurt, eggs/egg whites)
- **1–2 fists of veggies** (salads, roasted veg, stir-fry mixes)
- **1 cupped hand of carbs** (rice, potatoes, fruit, beans) *as needed for training and satisfaction*
- **1 thumb of fats** (olive oil, nuts, avocado) *watch portions—easy to overshoot*

Protein and high-volume foods tend to be more filling per calorie.

### Watch “easy-to-miss” calories
Common stealth sources:
- Cooking oils and butter
- Sugary coffee drinks
- Alcohol
- “Healthy” snacks (nuts, granola, trail mix)
- Restaurant sauces and dressings

Even a couple of these can erase a big chunk of a deficit.

### Use carbs strategically (don’t just cut them blindly)
Carbs aren’t “bad,” but portions matter. If rice is a staple for you, knowing the baseline helps: [how many calories are in 1 cup of rice cooked](/articles/how-many-calories-are-in-1-cup-of-rice-cooked). You can keep rice in your plan by:
- Measuring cooked portions for a week or two
- Pairing it with lean protein and vegetables
- Using smaller servings on lower-activity days

### Increase activity to reduce how low calories need to go
If your TDEE is on the lower side, trying to subtract 1,000 from food alone can be brutal. Adding activity can “fund” the deficit:
- More daily steps
- 2–4 strength sessions/week
- A few short cardio sessions (even 15–25 minutes)

This can let you eat more while still averaging the same weekly deficit.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### How many calories do I need to lose 2 pounds a week?
Most people aim for a **~1,000-calorie daily deficit**, so your target is roughly **TDEE − 1,000 calories/day**. Because TDEE varies by body size and activity, the exact calorie number is different for everyone.

### Should I eat less than my BMR to lose weight?
Eating below BMR can happen when someone is dieting aggressively, but it often makes it harder to get enough protein, fiber, and micronutrients—and it can feel miserable to sustain. A more practical approach is to base your target on **TDEE** and choose a deficit you can repeat consistently. More here: [should i eat less than my bmr to lose weight](/articles/should-i-eat-less-than-my-bmr-to-lose-weight).

### How many calories should I eat if my BMR is 1500?
BMR isn’t your daily “budget”—it’s your baseline at rest. Your eating target depends on your **TDEE** (BMR plus activity). If your BMR is 1500, your TDEE might be, for example, 1,900–2,400+ depending on lifestyle. Then you’d subtract your chosen deficit from that. See: [how many calories should i eat if my bmr is 1500](/articles/how-many-calories-should-i-eat-if-my-bmr-is-1500).

### What is the most accurate TDEE calculator?
No calculator is perfect because real-life activity and metabolism vary, but the most accurate approach is: use a reputable calculator to get a starting estimate, then **adjust based on 2–3 weeks of consistent tracking and weigh-in trends**. A breakdown of options: [what is the most accurate tdee calculator](/articles/what-is-the-most-accurate-tdee-calculator).
